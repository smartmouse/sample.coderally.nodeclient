# Code-Rally (Node.js Version)

Want to learn the popular Node.js while having fun? Then try the new Node.js version of IBM's Code Rally! Whether you are a complete Node Newbie, or an experienced Node.js veteran, test and hone your skills on the race track!

For more information, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/code-rally/entry/landing?lang=en">Offical Code Rally Blog</a>!

## Installation

There are two ways to get Code Rally (Node.js) running on your machine! Assuming that you have already <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> with NPM installed.

1. Use `npm install --save coderally-agent` at your Node application directory

2. Clone this GitHub repository directly to your Node application directory with `git clone`

## Code Examples

### Entering a race

	var Agent = require('../index.js');
	var myAgent = new Agent();

	...

	myAgent.enterRace({
		track_id : "0",
		username : "karan_challenge_na",
		user_id : "963",
		uniqueUserid : "116650285099720794308", // OPTIONAL IF OAUTH DISABLED ON SERVER
		file_name : "Testcar",
		vehicle_type: "car_yellow",
		accel : "1",
		weight : "1",
		armor : "0",
		traction : "0",
		turning : "1" 
	}, 'challenge-na.coderallycloud.com');

### Implementing a car AI

	var AIUtils = Agent.AIUtils;

	...

	myAgent.on('onRaceStart', function (ourCar) {
		console.log("Race is starting");
		prevPosition = ourCar.getCarStatus().getPosition();

		// Aggressive start
		var target = AIUtils.getClosestLane(ourCar.getCarStatus().getCheckPoint(), ourCar.getCarStatus().getPosition());
		ourCar.pushCarControl({
			carBrakePercent : 0,
			carAccelPercent : 100,
			carTarget : target
		})

	});
